## Frontend
The code for the frontend is kept in the "Frontend/" folder. We have a separate repository specifically for the frontend, which utilizes AWS Amplify. This repository serves as the source repository for the frontend.
The link to that repository is : https://github.com/12dash/Socialize

## Backend
The Backend code is stored in the "Backend/" folder which stores the lambda functions.
The lambda functions are further segregated based on their functionality such as all the polls related lambda functions are stored in the folder called "LambdaFunctions/polls/" inside the "LambdaFunctions/"

## API Gateway
